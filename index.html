<h1> Sonnet 56 </h1>
<h2> By William Shakespeare </h2>

  <p>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said</p>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<br>
Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,<br>
To-morrow sharpened in his former might:<br>
So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill<br>
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,<br>
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<br>
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.<br>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<br>
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new<br>
Come daily to the banks, that when they see<br>
Return of love, more blest may be the view;<br>
As call it winter, which being full of care,<br>
Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
